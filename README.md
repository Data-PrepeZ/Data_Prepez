# ðŸš€ Data-Prepez

**A fast, scalable, and intelligent data preprocessing library for machine learning workflows.**

Data-Prepez is an open-source Python library designed to simplify and accelerate the data preprocessing stage of machine learning. It automatically handles missing values, encoding, scaling, type detection, and supports tabular, text (NLP), and time series data â€” all while scaling efficiently to millions of rows.
